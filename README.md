# AppointmentJUnit
Appointment Setting and JUnit Tests
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I implemented several JUnit tests for this software that test all of the three input classifications (over the input length, no input, and the expected input). There are outcomes for all these forms of input and even provides feedback directly to the user so if their input isn't accepted they know exactly why.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I look at what a user would experience when using my code by taking a different perspective than that of a developer. I feign ignorance of the intricacies and background programs of the code when I test it so that I can understand how the average person would perceive my program. I make sure that any time the program doesn't perform as expected the user knows why and how to correct it.
How do I approach designing software?
I first look at the requirements of the system and pre-plan how I would go about performing the task. If it's a larger task I would use notes and mark off what is done one by one. I actively try to keep my code modular and commented so either I or someone who looks at the code later on can easily understand what's happening. Additionally, I test code procedurally as I write it so I can know if it's working. Finally, when the system frame is built I work to make sure the user feedback is clear and concise so that users can operate it with ease.
